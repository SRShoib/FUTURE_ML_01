# Sales Forecasting for Retail Business
## Future Internship Company - ML Task 01
## Objective:
To develop a forecasting model capable of predicting future sales trends with the goal of improving business planning, demand estimation, and inventory management.
## What I Did:
Using a real-world sales dataset, I performed time series analysis and built a forecasting pipeline leveraging both classical and ML-based techniques. From preprocessing and trend identification to seasonality decomposition and forecasting, the project covered it all!
## Skills Applied & Developed
•	Time Series Forecasting using Prophet<br>
•	Trend & Seasonality Analysis<br>
•	Regression Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)<br>
•	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering<br>
•	Forecast Visualization and Interpretation
## Tools & Technologies
  •	Python: Primary programming language<br>
  •	Facebook Prophet: Time series modeling<br>
  •	Scikit-learn: Forecast evaluation (MAE, RMSE)<br>
  •	Pandas: Data handling and feature engineering<br>
  •	Matplotlib: Visual representation of trends and forecasts
## Highlights:
  •	Created a multi-step forecasting model tailored for monthly sales trends.<br>
  •	Visualized forecast confidence intervals and seasonal components.<br>
  •	Applied regression metrics (MAE, RMSE) to evaluate forecast performance.<br>
  •	Delivered intuitive plots showing trend shifts and forecast accuracy.
## Dataset
Dataset Source: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data">Sample Dataset (Kaggle)</a>
## Key Findings
  •	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $1,753.77<br>
  •	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $2,104.69<br>
  •	Observed a consistent monthly sales increase, peaking towards the year-end<br>
  •	Strong weekly seasonality pattern found, particularly around the start of each month<br>
  •	Forecasts project a positive sales growth trend over the next 6 months<br>
  •	Generated visualizations highlighting forecast components (trend, seasonality, residuals)
