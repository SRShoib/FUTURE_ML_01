# Sales Forecasting for Retail Business
## Future Internship Company - ML Task 01
##Objective:
To develop a forecasting model capable of predicting future sales trends with the goal of improving business planning, demand estimation, and inventory management.
🔍 What I Did:
Using a real-world sales dataset, I performed time series analysis and built a forecasting pipeline leveraging both classical and ML-based techniques. From preprocessing and trend identification to seasonality decomposition and forecasting, the project covered it all!
🧠 Skills Applied & Developed
•	Time Series Forecasting using Prophet
•	Trend & Seasonality Analysis
•	Regression Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
•	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
•	Forecast Visualization and Interpretation
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
•	Python: Primary programming language
•	Facebook Prophet: Time series modeling
•	Scikit-learn: Forecast evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
•	Pandas: Data handling and feature engineering
•	Matplotlib: Visual representation of trends and forecasts
📊 Highlights:
•	Created a multi-step forecasting model tailored for monthly sales trends.
•	Visualized forecast confidence intervals and seasonal components.
•	Applied regression metrics (MAE, RMSE) to evaluate forecast performance.
•	Delivered intuitive plots showing trend shifts and forecast accuracy.
📈 Key Findings
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $1,753.77
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $2,104.69
•	Observed a consistent monthly sales increase, peaking towards the year-end
•	Strong weekly seasonality pattern found, particularly around the start of each month
•	Forecasts project a positive sales growth trend over the next 6 months
•	Generated visualizations highlighting forecast components (trend, seasonality, residuals)
