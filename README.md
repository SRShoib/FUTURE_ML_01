# Sales Forecasting for Retail Business
## Future Internship Company - ML Task 01
## Objective:
To develop a forecasting model capable of predicting future sales trends with the goal of improving business planning, demand estimation, and inventory management.
## What I Did:
Using a real-world sales dataset, I performed time series analysis and built a forecasting pipeline leveraging both classical and ML-based techniques. From preprocessing and trend identification to seasonality decomposition and forecasting, the project covered it all!
## Skills Applied & Developed
  •	Time Series Forecasting using Prophet<br>
  •	Trend & Seasonality Analysis<br>
  •	Regression Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)<br>
  •	Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering<br>
  •	Forecast Visualization and Interpretation
## Tools & Technologies
  •	Python: Primary programming language
  •	Facebook Prophet: Time series modeling
  •	Scikit-learn: Forecast evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
  •	Pandas: Data handling and feature engineering
  •	Matplotlib: Visual representation of trends and forecasts
## Highlights:
  •	Created a multi-step forecasting model tailored for monthly sales trends.
  •	Visualized forecast confidence intervals and seasonal components.
  •	Applied regression metrics (MAE, RMSE) to evaluate forecast performance.
  •	Delivered intuitive plots showing trend shifts and forecast accuracy.
## Dataset
Kaggle Sample Sales Data: https://lnkd.in/g62a6HPH
## Key Findings
  •	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $1,753.77
  •	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $2,104.69
  •	Observed a consistent monthly sales increase, peaking towards the year-end
  •	Strong weekly seasonality pattern found, particularly around the start of each month
  •	Forecasts project a positive sales growth trend over the next 6 months
  •	Generated visualizations highlighting forecast components (trend, seasonality, residuals)
